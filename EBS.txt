go to volumes
edit the root volume by giving the name root_vol
create volume
gp2
16GIB
zone 2b
create 
rename to data vol

select the data vol
attach volume
select the running instance 
select device name /dev/sdb

go to terminal
lsblk
mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdb
blkid
mkdir /aishu
mount /dev/xvdb /aishu/
cd /aishu/
touch aishu.txt{1..100}
ll
cd
blkid copy the data device name uid
vim /etc/fstab
paste the uid /aishu ext4 default 0 0

storing the same data in different zones

launch an instance in different zone like 2a

go to snapshot
create snapshot
resource typle select volume
volume ID -----> Data volume
give description ---> this is a data volume

click on actions
attach volume
select the instance
select the device name
attach

go to terminal
blkid 
mkdir /data
mount /dev/xvdb /data/
lsblk
cd /data/

storage in different region

go to the existing instance 
click on snapshot
select and go to actions
copy snapshot
give the destination whichever eg : ap-southeast
copy snapshot

launch

terminal
ssh connect
sudo su -

rename to data_vol
select the data vol and attach the volume with instance id and device launch
lsblk
mkdir /Singapore
mount /dev/xvdbb /Singapore
lsblk

RESIZING THE VOLUMES

select the existing volume and click go to action_---> modify volume
gp2
24GiB
modify

terminal 
lsblk----->24GiB
df -h------> 16GiB
blkid check ur datavolume
resize2fs  /dev/xvdb
df -h ------> 24GiB
cd /Singapore
ll


IF VOLUME IS NOT UTILIZED PROPERLY IT GETS WASTED SO WE ARE CREATING THE  new volume copying the same data in smaller storage

create a volume
gp2
15GiB
same zone
create the volume
attach the volume to the instance -----> rename

terminal 
blkid
mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdc
mkdir /tech/
mount /dev/xvdc /tech/
